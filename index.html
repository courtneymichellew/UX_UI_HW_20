          <h2>Project Overview</h1>
          <p>Camp Horizon helps at-risk, abused and neglected children, most of whom are in foster care, and provides them with a safe place that brings them nourishment, mentoring and love. This organization has a profound impact on the lives of these children and helps empower them to make good decisions to lead healthy and productive lives.
          </p>
          
          <h2>The Problem</h1>
          <p>Camp Horizonâ€™s current website is in need of an update to enhance its trustworthiness with users who want to donate to the organization.
          </p>
          
          <h2>The Solution</h1>
          <p>A newly designed user interface including homepage and donation page with convenient checkout modal.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Tools</h1>

            <h3>Proto-Personas</h3>
            <p>We first started by calling out the three types of major users of the Camp Horizon site. We identified the Donator, the Volunteer, and the Foster Parent. These proto-personas helped us to analyze the website from three different angles, broadening our understanding of how the site is used.

            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>Next, we conducted 5 user observation interviews that gave us data to synthesize.

            <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
            <p>During this exercise, we looked at three sites, Camp Twin Lakes, The Boys and Girls Club, and Samaritas. The positive takeaways were to utilize plenty of inviting photography, give a prominent and consistent position for the donation button, and consider a pop-up modal for the donation checkout function.

        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>Because the themes of the affinity map focused on the experience of a person who wants to donate, we decided that the Donator user persona would be the best one to focus on for the website.

        <h3>User Insight</h3>
        <p>A philanthropist who grew up as a foster child now wants to give back by volunteering or donating to an organization that helps foster kids. He discovered Camp Horizon online but finds the website confusing and he fears the organization may be untrustworthy. He worries that the money that he donates won't reach the children that he wants to help. He wishes the website was more clear and concise and the volunteer and donate actions were more easily accessible.
        </p>

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>When researching organizations that help foster children, a potential donor/volunteer finds the Camp Horizon website confusing and he fears the organization may be untrustworthy. He worries that the money that he donates won't reach the children that he wants to help.
        </p>
        <p>How might we redesign the Camp Horizon website to be more intuitive, actionable, and trustworthy for potential donors and volunteers?
